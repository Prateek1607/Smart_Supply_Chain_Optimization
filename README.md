# Smart Supply Chain Optimization
**AI-Powered Analytics for Forecasting, Fraud Detection, and Business Intelligence**

This project showcases how data science and automation can transform supply chain decision-making.  
Using the **DataCo Smart Supply Chain dataset** from Kaggle, it applies **machine learning** and **data visualization** to forecast demand, detect fraud, and uncover operational patterns that drive efficiency and trust across the network.


## Project Overview
Supply chain systems generate massive amounts of transactional data — but without the right analytics, this data remains underutilized.  
The **Smart Supply Chain Optimization** project builds predictive models to convert this raw data into **actionable insights**, improving visibility, performance, and risk management.

### Key Objectives
- 📈 **Demand Forecasting:** Predict sales trends and plan inventory effectively.  
- 🧠 **Fraud Detection:** Identify anomalous order behaviors using ML classifiers.  
- 🔍 **Clustering Analysis:** Group similar orders or customers to reveal behavioral insights.  
- 📊 **Business Dashboards:** Visualize KPIs and model results in Tableau for real-time decisions.

## 🧩 Features
- End-to-end ML workflow with **H2O AutoML** and **MLflow tracking**  
- Automated **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling**  
- **Explainable AI** with model interpretability for trust and transparency  
- Interactive **Tableau dashboards** showcasing performance metrics and trends  
- Reproducible, modular structure for scalability across new datasets
