# Smart Supply Chain Optimization
**AI-Powered Analytics for Forecasting, Fraud Detection, and Business Intelligence**

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence and data analytics can revolutionize supply chain management.  
Using the **DataCo Smart Supply Chain dataset** from Kaggle, the project builds predictive models to **forecast demand**, **detect fraud**, and **cluster order behaviors** for smarter business operations and risk mitigation.



## Project Overview
Modern supply chains face challenges like fluctuating demand, operational risks, and fraudulent activity.  
**Smart Supply Chain Optimization** leverages data-driven modeling and visualization to convert raw transaction data into actionable insights that improve decision-making and operational resilience.

### Key Objectives
- **Forecast Product Demand** for the next quarter using advanced regression and time-series models.  
- **Detect Fraudulent Transactions** with supervised learning and AutoML pipelines.  
- **Cluster Orders** to discover hidden behavioral and operational patterns.  
- **Visualize KPIs and Trends** using Tableau dashboards for executives and analysts.



## Dataset
**Source:** [DataCo Smart Supply Chain for Big Data Analysis — Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/dataco-smart-supply-chain-for-big-data-analysis)  
**File Used:** `DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv`  

The dataset includes **transactional, customer, product, and logistics attributes** such as:
- Order ID, Product Category, Sales Channel  
- Customer Region, Order Date, Delivery Date  
- Payment Information, Fraud Flag, Quantity Ordered  

This data enables comprehensive analysis of **sales performance, fraud patterns, and customer behaviors** across multiple dimensions.
